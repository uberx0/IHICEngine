How to Create a Map for the Game (Level File Format: 1.lvl)
Map Format:

Use a text file with a .lvl extension (e.g., 1.lvl).
The map consists of numbers:
1 represents walls (impassable).
0 represents open paths (walkable spaces).
2 represents the player's starting position.
3 represents enemies.
4 represents the finish point.
Creating the Map:

Create a text file with a .lvl extension (for example, 1.lvl).
Each line in the file corresponds to one row in the game map.
Each number (either 1, 0, 2, 3, or 4) in the row represents a specific type of space.
Basic Structure:

The map should be surrounded by walls (1), ensuring the player cannot go outside the boundaries.
The player (2) must be placed in an open path (0).
Enemies (3) and the finish (4) should also be placed on open paths, not in walls.
Example Level File (1.lvl):

1111111111
1200000001
1011101111
1000100001
1110101011
1000101001
1010111011
1000000041
1111111111

1: Walls
0: Open paths
2: Player's starting position (to be added at a specific point in an open path)
3: Enemy (to be added at a point in an open path)
4: Finish (to be added at a point in an open path)
How to Place Key Elements:

Player's Starting Position (2): This must be at an open spot (i.e., a 0), where the player begins the game.
Enemies (3): Place them at a specific location to create challenges for the player.
Finish (4): Mark the location where the player must reach to win the level.
Save the File:

Save the text file with a .lvl extension (e.g., 1.lvl) and place it in the lvls directory of the game.

U can install name of the window by writing something like "#name of the window". U need write it before u write map scheme.
U also can add some music by writing !nameofthesong.mp3/.ogg and other after writing name of the window. Dont forget to put music file
in folder "music".

That all. Goodluck!
